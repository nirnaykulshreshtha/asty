## 2025-10-23 – Reusable BulletedListCard and MembershipBenefitsGrid refactor

Context: Multiple sections used near-identical bulleted list markup (heading, accent dot, title, description). We extracted a reusable component to reduce duplication and applied it to the benefits grid rendered on the home page.

Changes:
- Added `src/components/ui/BulletedListCard.tsx` with mappers for `key`, `title`, and `description`, plus optional `heading`. Built atop `ContentCard` to inherit reveal/hover behaviors. Includes aggressive render logging.
- Refactored `src/components/pages/home/MembershipBenefitsGrid.tsx` to render two `BulletedListCard` instances: Position Benefits and Network Advantages.
- Home page (`src/app/page.tsx`) already includes `MembershipBenefitsGrid` as a dedicated section and passes `motionReduced`.

Files Added/Modified:
- `src/components/ui/BulletedListCard.tsx` (new)
- `src/components/pages/home/MembershipBenefitsGrid.tsx` (updated to use reusable component)
- `src/app/page.tsx` (previously updated to render benefits section)

Impact:
- Removes duplicated Tailwind markup and consolidates list styles.
- Maintains accessibility and integrates with IntersectionObserver reveal via underlying `ContentCard`.
- Preserves aggressive logging across components for debugging.

Follow-ups:
- Consider migrating other list-style sections to `BulletedListCard` as patterns emerge.

## 2025-10-23 – SectionHeader added above MembershipBenefitsGrid

Context: Benefits grid needed a consistent section heading and deep-link anchor for navigation from the header.

Changes:
- Imported and used `SectionHeader` in `src/app/page.tsx` above `MembershipBenefitsGrid`.
- Wrapped in a `<section id="membership">` container for `#membership` anchor targeting.
- Header copy: label "Membership", title "Benefits and Network Advantages", concise description.

Impact:
- Consistent visual hierarchy with other sections.
- Enables header navigation to land precisely at the benefits area.

## 2025-10-23 – RegistrationSection replaces MembershipProgressSidebar in MemesSection

Context: The MemesSection needed a user registration interface instead of just displaying membership progress statistics. Users should be able to register for Early Membership directly from this section using wallet connection only.

Changes:
- Created `src/components/pages/home/RegistrationSection.tsx` with wallet-only registration functionality:
  - Wallet connection as the only registration method (no email required)
  - Optional referral address input field with Ethereum address validation
  - Registration success state with confirmation and referral display
  - Benefits summary display (12-level network, dividends, lifetime position)
  - Progress indicator showing current membership count vs presale trigger
  - Responsive design with gradient background and decorative elements
  - Aggressive logging for debugging registration flow
- Updated `src/components/pages/home/MemesSection.tsx` to import and use `RegistrationSection` instead of `MembershipProgressSidebar`
- Updated component documentation to reflect the wallet-only registration interface

Features:
- Wallet-only registration (no email forms)
- Optional referral address with real-time validation
- Ethereum address format validation (0x + 40 hex characters)
- Simulated wallet connection process with loading states
- Clear pricing display ($100 lifetime position)
- Visual progress bar showing membership progress toward presale trigger
- Referral address display in success state
- Consistent styling with existing design system
- Scroll-based reveal animations

Impact:
- Transforms the membership section from informational to interactive
- Enables direct user registration via wallet connection
- Supports referral system with optional address input
- Maintains visual consistency with existing components
- Provides clear call-to-action for membership signup
