## 2025-01-27 – Tokenomics Chart Visualization

Context: The tokenomics section needed a proper data visualization to show token distribution more clearly, particularly the presale rounds and remaining supply breakdown. The existing static donut visual was not providing enough detail about how the 21M tokens are distributed.

Changes:
- **Enhanced `src/components/pages/home/TokenomicsSection.tsx`** with interactive chart visualization:
  - Added tokenomics data structure with breakdown across presale rounds (10L, 10L, 5L tokens)
  - Implemented interactive pie/donut chart using Recharts library (already in dependencies)
  - Added ChartContainer with proper tooltip and legend functionality
  - Included "Remaining Supply" slice showing 18.5M tokens after presale allocation
  - Maintained existing UI styling with gradient backgrounds and animations
  - Added comprehensive logging for debugging chart interactions
  - Legend shows formatted values in millions for easy reading
- **Palette Alignment**: Updated `TOKENOMICS_DATA` colors to pull from global `--chart-*` CSS variables for consistent theming; remaining supply uses `--muted` to stay subdued against presale slices.
- **Updated documentation** to reflect chart integration and data structure
- Imported Chart components from existing UI library (`src/components/ui/chart.tsx`)

Features:
- **Interactive Chart**: Hover tooltips showing exact token counts
- **Legend Display**: Shows presale rounds and remaining supply with formatted values (1.0M, 2.5M tokens)
- **Visual Breakdown**: Donut chart with distinct colors for each allocation
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Accessible**: Proper ARIA labels and interactive elements
- **Color Scheme**: Uses primary color gradients (hsl 262°) for consistency

Token Distribution:
- Presale Round 1: 1,000,000 tokens (1.0M)
- Presale Round 2: 1,000,000 tokens (1.0M)
- Presale Round 3: 500,000 tokens (0.5M)
- Remaining Supply: 18,500,000 tokens (18.5M)
- **Total: 21,000,000 tokens (21M)**

Impact:
- Much clearer visualization of token distribution
- Interactive experience helps users understand allocation breakdown
- Professional appearance with proper chart library integration
- Maintains existing design system and visual language
- Better user understanding of how tokens are allocated
- Debug-friendly with comprehensive logging
- Responsive and accessible for all users

## 2025-10-23 – Reusable BulletedListCard and MembershipBenefitsGrid refactor

Context: Multiple sections used near-identical bulleted list markup (heading, accent dot, title, description). We extracted a reusable component to reduce duplication and applied it to the benefits grid rendered on the home page.

Changes:
- Added `src/components/ui/BulletedListCard.tsx` with mappers for `key`, `title`, and `description`, plus optional `heading`. Built atop `ContentCard` to inherit reveal/hover behaviors. Includes aggressive render logging.
- Refactored `src/components/pages/home/MembershipBenefitsGrid.tsx` to render two `BulletedListCard` instances: Position Benefits and Network Advantages.
- Home page (`src/app/page.tsx`) already includes `MembershipBenefitsGrid` as a dedicated section and passes `motionReduced`.

Files Added/Modified:
- `src/components/ui/BulletedListCard.tsx` (new)
- `src/components/pages/home/MembershipBenefitsGrid.tsx` (updated to use reusable component)
- `src/app/page.tsx` (previously updated to render benefits section)

Impact:
- Removes duplicated Tailwind markup and consolidates list styles.
- Maintains accessibility and integrates with IntersectionObserver reveal via underlying `ContentCard`.
- Preserves aggressive logging across components for debugging.

Follow-ups:
- Consider migrating other list-style sections to `BulletedListCard` as patterns emerge.

## 2025-10-23 – SectionHeader added above MembershipBenefitsGrid

Context: Benefits grid needed a consistent section heading and deep-link anchor for navigation from the header.

Changes:
- Imported and used `SectionHeader` in `src/app/page.tsx` above `MembershipBenefitsGrid`.
- Wrapped in a `<section id="membership">` container for `#membership` anchor targeting.
- Header copy: label "Membership", title "Benefits and Network Advantages", concise description.

Impact:
- Consistent visual hierarchy with other sections.
- Enables header navigation to land precisely at the benefits area.
