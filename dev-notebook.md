## 2025-10-23 – Reusable BulletedListCard and MembershipBenefitsGrid refactor

Context: Multiple sections used near-identical bulleted list markup (heading, accent dot, title, description). We extracted a reusable component to reduce duplication and applied it to the benefits grid rendered on the home page.

Changes:
- Added `src/components/ui/BulletedListCard.tsx` with mappers for `key`, `title`, and `description`, plus optional `heading`. Built atop `ContentCard` to inherit reveal/hover behaviors. Includes aggressive render logging.
- Refactored `src/components/pages/home/MembershipBenefitsGrid.tsx` to render two `BulletedListCard` instances: Position Benefits and Network Advantages.
- Home page (`src/app/page.tsx`) already includes `MembershipBenefitsGrid` as a dedicated section and passes `motionReduced`.

Files Added/Modified:
- `src/components/ui/BulletedListCard.tsx` (new)
- `src/components/pages/home/MembershipBenefitsGrid.tsx` (updated to use reusable component)
- `src/app/page.tsx` (previously updated to render benefits section)

Impact:
- Removes duplicated Tailwind markup and consolidates list styles.
- Maintains accessibility and integrates with IntersectionObserver reveal via underlying `ContentCard`.
- Preserves aggressive logging across components for debugging.

Follow-ups:
- Consider migrating other list-style sections to `BulletedListCard` as patterns emerge.

## 2025-10-23 – SectionHeader added above MembershipBenefitsGrid

Context: Benefits grid needed a consistent section heading and deep-link anchor for navigation from the header.

Changes:
- Imported and used `SectionHeader` in `src/app/page.tsx` above `MembershipBenefitsGrid`.
- Wrapped in a `<section id="membership">` container for `#membership` anchor targeting.
- Header copy: label "Membership", title "Benefits and Network Advantages", concise description.

Impact:
- Consistent visual hierarchy with other sections.
- Enables header navigation to land precisely at the benefits area.
